        <p>My name is Andres Mills Gallego and as you may have guessed correctly, I was not born in the US, I am from Colombia originally.  I didn't study much post high school in terms of formal education, but I was (and still am) heavily involved in the construction industry.  Working with the family business I learned the skills of my craft as well as developed extensive knowledge in the business side of things.  Woodworking was always something that I enjoyed.  I love being able to take a raw material and shape it into something new, beautiful and interesting!  I have always strived to improve and to continue to learn as much as I can.  I started my own woodworking business about 16 years ago and have been lucky enough to be able to shape it into a business that I am proud of.  I am currently studying computer science and web development.  I look forward to utilizing my current skillset to learn as much as I can in the months to come!</p>

      <h3>A bit more about me......</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Its true, I absolutely love Sushi!  It is one of my favorite foods (it may actually be my #1).</li>
          <li>I was born in Colombia, but moved to the United States as a child.  My family still went back every year to visit and because of that both countries feel like home to me.</li>
          <li>I love to travel and look to do so as often as I can.  It is something that my entire family agrees on and our year is often spent planning our next trip.</li>
          <li>I am a huge Pop culture nerd and love things like Star Wars, Marvel Comics and anything Disney (Disney is an obsession really)</li>
          <li>Like I mentioned above, I am a lifelong woodworker.  I built the Walnut staircase below from scratch!.</li>

## Learning Journal Notes

**First _real_ lab**

I feel that this project went quite well.  It was a perfect project to jump back in where I left off in Code 102.  It also allowed me to learn, research, then implement some of the new things that I picked up this week.  

I am not sure if I have any specific questions just yet.  I am trying to soak in as much as I can and play around with my code as much as possible so it hopefully sinks in!

How long did it take me to complete this?  I am not exactly sure (I will be sure to keep track of the duration for next time!), but if I had to guess I would say a few hours.  I expected it to take longer actually, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of the structures came back to me quickly.  I spent most of my time coming up with what to say, and then tweaking my CSS to get the page to look just how I wanted it to.
